# Apple_Nasdaq_Trading_Analysis

Welcome to the Apple and Nasdaq Trading Analysis project repository. This project is designed to analyze trading data for Apple (AAPL) and Nasdaq (^IXIC), leveraging advanced data engineering and analysis techniques to uncover meaningful trading signals and trends. The project incorporates state-of-the-art indicators, visualizations, and scalable technologies to provide a robust platform for financial analysis.

# Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the entire workflow of financial data
analysis, from fetching raw data to deriving actionable insights. Key
highlights include:

**1. Data Acquisition: Automated fetching of historical financial data
using the Yahoo Finance API.**

**2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality through
rigorous preprocessing techniques.**

**3. Feature Engineering:**

- Data fetching and cleaning using the Yahoo Finance API.

- Advanced feature engineering, including Nadaraya-Watson Envelope,
Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA),Supertrend, EMA 50, MACD, RSI,
Bollinger Bands, Trail(EMA 14), ATR and WaveTrend Oscillator (WT).

- Visual analysis with correlation matrices, outlier detection, and
trend charts.

- Scalable implementation with PySpark and MSSQL for large datasets.

**4. Data Visualization: Comprehensive charts and correlation heatmaps
for easy interpretation of trends and patterns.**

**5. Scalable Processing: Integration with PySpark and MSSQL for
handling large datasets and ensuring scalability.**

# Implemented Indicators and Features

To enhance the accuracy of prediction models by extracting more
meaningful insights from market data using advanced financial
indicators, the following were implemented:

**1. Trend Analysis**

- Nadaraya-Watson Surface: A flexible method for predicting market
  trends.

- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Identifies trend
  reversal points.

- KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average): An adaptive moving average
  that adjusts to price movements.

- Ichimoku: A versatile indicator analyzing support, resistance,
  momentum, and trend direction.

**2. Momentum Indicators**

- RSI (Relative Strength Index): Identifies overbought and oversold
  levels.

- WaveTrend Oscillator (WT): Detects momentum and extreme conditions in
  price movements.

**3. Volatility and Strength Measurements**

- Bollinger Bands: Measures price volatility and detects extreme price
  levels.

- ATR (Average True Range): Evaluates market volatility.

**4. Moving Averages and Other Indicators**

- Trail Indicator (EMA 14 and EMA 50): Tracks price movements using two
  exponential moving averages.

- EMA-Based Tracking: Assesses price trends using EMA14 and EMA50.

**5.  Analysis Process**

- Supertrend: An effective indicator for trend determination based on
  volatility.

**- Feature Calculation**

   Each indicator was added as a separate column to the dataset.

**- Buy-Sell Signal Generation**

   Indicators generated buy and sell signals based on predefined
   threshold values.
